								<p>The March for Science Chicago Expo is an opportunity for Chicagoans to take their next step in supporting science in Chicago; whether it’s getting involved in Chicago’s scientific community, supporting scientific organizations, or learning about the science of the world around them.</p>
								<p>We’re inviting individual scientists (graduated or students), organizations, and nonprofit groups to join us at our Expo to engage Chicagoans in science-based experiences. Exhibitors at the Expo can promote their role in Chicago’s scientific community or their causes to a motivated, interested audience of 40,000 Chicagoans. We hope you’ll consider joining us at the Expo as an investment in Chicago, its citizens, and its science.</p>

										<h3>FAQ</h3>
										<b>When does my organization need to be at the Expo location?</b>
										<br /><br />
										<p>Once your application has been approved and your fee paid, we will provide set-up/tear-down instructions. Please note that at least one representative from your organization must be present at your table from set-up to tear-down. Plan accordingly if you have representatives who would like to participate in the rally/march.</p>
										<b>What happens to the Expo if it rains?</b>

The application and exhibitor fees are non-refundable.</p>
