					<p>The March for Science Chicago Expo is an opportunity for Chicagoans to take their next step in supporting science in Chicago. Our goal is to bridge the public and the science it serves through volunteering opportunities with Chicago’s scientific community, supporting scientific organizations, or learning more about the science of the world around them and how to support them.</p>
					<p>We’re inviting individual scientists (graduated or students), organizations, and nonprofit groups to join us at our Expo to engage Chicagoans in science-based experiences and how to become involved through support or other opportunities. Exhibitors at the Expo are encouraged to discuss how their science serves Chicago’s scientific community or their causes to a motivated, interested audience of 40,000 march participants.</p>
					<p>This is opportunity to join a conversation and talk directly about science and how it serves our community.</p>
					<br />
					<section id="call">

							<h3>FAQ</h3>
							<b>What is the purpose of the Expo?</b>
							<br /><br />
							<p>After the march, we want Chicagoans to be able to take their next step in supporting the science community and get involved in scientific efforts:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Research happening in Chicago that directly impacts our community</li>
								<li>Learn about participating in Citizen Science efforts</li>
								<li>Sign up to volunteer with organizations to directly impact our community</li>
								<li>Find out more about how you can help guide science in The Science City</li>
							</ul>
							<b>Will I be able to park at the Expo?</b>
							<p>
								Parking at the Expo, Field Museum, and Soldier Field will not be available. If you need to park your car, we suggest parking at the Millennium Parking Garage.
							</p>
